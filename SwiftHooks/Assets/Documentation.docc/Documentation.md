# ``SwiftHooks``

SwiftHooks is a data state management library for Swift. It is designed to be used both in SwiftUI and UIKit applications. 

## Overview

SwiftHooks can support any type of data state management.   
With `useState`, you can create immutable data state for view rendering.  
With `useEffect`, you can observe state changes and perform side effects.  
With `useContext`, you can share states among multiple scopes.
